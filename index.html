            <h2>Consider Your Audience</h2>
            <p>When curating a collection of jams, the first question you must answer is: "who is this for?" Everything about the playlist hinges on this crucial information. If you think you can make a playlist for every occasion, youre just plain wrong. Each playlist must be targeted carefully to the ears it will hopefully grace. What are you trying to <em>say?</em> </p>

             <h3>a party</h3>
             <p>so you're planning to bogart the aux cord at an upcoming event. What a dream! But beware: with great party power comes great party responsibilty. Your playlist is going to set the mood for this whole evening. You're going to need crowd pleasers, up and down tempo tracks, and a couple of fun surprises. </p>
             <h3>a crush</h3>
             <p>A tale as old as time. You meet someone, you want them to think you're the coolest person they've ever met, so you make them a mix of tunes that you think will communicate that your taste is above reproach. Don't come on too strong with the love songs, but some flirty tracks will go a long way. They'll really be impressed if you throw in songs from several genres, including stuff that it wouldn't be obvious that you would be into. You contain multitudes.</p>
             <h3>your dang self</h3>
             <p>The king of all playlists. You're going to listen to this while you drive, run, or powerwash the deck. If you want to be pumped up, only put songs on that you know will get your heartrate up. If you want to sink into melancholy, don't let anybody tell you that you put too many Death Cab songs on there. They don't know your life!</p>

            <h2>Choose Your Weapon</h2>
            <p>OK, you know who this playlist is going to get moving and grooving. How do you want to deliver the tunes? Remember, you can and should judge a mix by its cover. </p>
            <h3>streaming service</h3>
            <p>The most practical option for the majority of us is going to be the streaming service of your choice. Makes sense for a party if you know that you'll be able to connect your phone. If you don't have a headphone jack, come prepared with an adapter or face a musicless night and an angry mob. </p>

            <h3>cd-r</h3>
            <p>We used to have TOWERS of these bad boys just waiting to be burned on our dad's Gateway desktop. These are great for if you need to give music to a boomer.</p>

            <h3>cassette</h3>
            <p>For the pure of heart, the only option. Nothing can compare to having to wind a bunch of tape back into one of these with a pencil eraser. Whomever you give one of these relics to will be sure to be charmed, regardless of their inability to play it irl.</p>

         <h2>Order &amp; Flow</h2>
         <img src = "images\recordbois.jpg" alt = "screenshot of jack black and john cusack in high fidelity record store">
         <p>Shuffle is the worst thing that ever happened to the art of playlist making. Intentional flow from one song into another is what makes the experience of a playlist so personal. Don't just add a bunch of songs in any random order. Make sure you don't have jarring transitions, and be aware of the peaks and valleys you're creating with your sonic manifesto.</p>
         <h3>the rules</h3>
         <p>In <em>High Fidelity</em> (2000), main character Rob (John Cusack) lays out some rules for "the making of a great compilation tape". I've always followed these rules and have never been led astray. Rob says:</p>
         <p id="quote">"You gotta kick off with a killer, to grab attention. Then you got to take it up a notch, but you don't wanna blow your wad, so then you got to cool it off a notch."</p>
        <p>Start your playlist with 3 songs following Rob's rules, and you'll be on the right track.</p>
         <h3>kill your darlings</h3>
         <p>Your mixtape shouldn't be over 90 minutes long. It shouldn't contain songs that don't quite fit the vibe, and if you can't find a place for a track, no matter how precious it is to you, you've gotta cut it. There's always vol. 2!</p>
